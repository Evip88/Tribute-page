        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>
          Poodles 3 is a group of determined and enthusiastic baby coders. They
          look forward to learning new things, and with their creative minds,
          they will rise far beyond their own expectations. With teamwork and
          plenty of practice, the long road ahead will become easier to
          travel—and soon, the reward will be within their reach.

          <h3>Elvis</h3>
          <p>
            Elvis was a member of Team Potatoes, until destruction came and Team
            Potatoes was no more. Many died, but some survived. Five years
            later, Elvis managed to find new friends and a new team called the
            Poodles, where he took on new battles.
            <br />
            <br />
            Together with his loyal friends Julia and Carina, they swore that no
            matter what, they would always do their best..

          <h3>Carina</h3>
          <p>
            Carina was a lone wolf, used to go the road alone. Years of solitude
            had taught her to depend only in herself.
            <br />
            <br />
            Untill one day she thought to herself "Isn't there more out there?"
            A bird sitting in a tree looked down on her and said. "Go to
            Technigo, there you will find others of the same mind."

            <br />
            <br />The lone wolf hesitated before deciding to take a chance. A
            few months later and she is running with a pack of her own poodles
          </p>

          <h3>Julia</h3>
          <p>
            Julia, together with her cat, found a lost potato and a pack of
            poodles to join. She hadn’t traveled far or long, but she discovered
            a path that aligned with her interests. Though she has no sense of
            direction, with willpower and the help of her fellow poodles, she
            will hopefully find her way in the end.
            <br />
            <br />
            With many battles already won, there are still many more to come.
